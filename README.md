# SurfaceViscousFlows
Forked from SurfaceBulkViscousFlows to work on mechanochemical models that use the original's code as a basis, removing the bulk flow contribution to focus on having more elements on the cell surface.

Original premise of the main repository:
Repository that holds the Julia software with code demonstrators of the numerical examples in the paper _"Unfitted finite element modelling of surface-bulk viscous flows in animal cells"_. https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05723

## List of examples

New examples are being worked on right now.

Original examples from the original repository:

- _Section 4.1 Verification examples_

  - [Verification with dynamic surface](examples/Verification/VerificationWithDynamicSurface.jl)
- _Section 4.2 Self-organised shape emergence_
  - [Shape emergence](examples/ShapeEmergence/ShapeEmergence.jl)
- _Section 4.3 Relaxation dynamics_
  - [Pear](examples/RelaxationDynamics/Pear.jl)

  - [2D axisymmetric division](examples/CellCleavage/2DAxisymmetricCleavage.jl)
  - [3D division](examples/CellCleavage/3DCleavage.jl)

## Instructions to run the examples

### Prerequisites

  - A Julia installation ([link to instructions](https://julialang.org/install/))

### Running an example

  - Clone the repository at a path of your choice
  - Open a Julia interactive session on the repository directory

```
  git clone git@github.com:ericneiva/SurfaceBulkViscousFlows.git
  cd SurfaceBulkViscousFlows
  julia --project
```

  - Before _running an example for the first time_, set up the project dependencies

```julia
  julia> # press ] to enter Pkg mode...
  (SurfaceBulkViscousFlows) pkg> instantiate
```

  - Run the example of your choice

```julia
  julia> include("examples/Verification/VerificationInFixedSphere.jl")
```

  - Output files are generated in the folder for inspection
